Title: About Me            


Hello, my name is James Triveri.

I am a senior data scientist at Arity, a mobility data and analytics company focused 
on making transportation smarter, safer, and more useful for everyone. My primary 
interests are ML/DL, scientific computing and performance optimization. 

I'm an ardent supporter of Free Software, as well as a long-time user and 
advocate of the Python programming language. I am an active contributor to 
Open Source, and maintain a few projects of my own. You can check out my 
GitHub page [here](https://github.com/jtrive84).

I graduated from Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois with training in 
Mathematics and Physics and received an M.S. in Computer Science from the Georgia
Institute of Technology specializing in Machine Learning.

My favorite animal is the sloth (the Bradypodidae variety).

My CV is available [here]({attach}../downloads/James_D_Triveri_CV.pdf).

Thanks for checking in!
